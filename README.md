  # Ticketing System
  Front View is just for description of code flow.
  So it was made by Figma LLM, it's original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/nAcDQvPdrnmQrjD824No7G/Ticketing-System.
  It was based on original project of Figma, and I developed this as Korean's Booking Site like Idol's Concert Ticketing or Musical Ticketing.

  The front-end UI is used solely to illustrate the system and event flow.
  It was generated using Figma LLM, based on an original Figma community project:
  https://www.figma.com/design/nAcDQvPdrnmQrjD824No7G/Ticketing-System

  I adapted the structure and screen flow to fit a Korean-style ticketing domain,
  such as idol concert or musical booking systems, while focusing primarily on
  the backend architecture and Kafka-based event processing.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
